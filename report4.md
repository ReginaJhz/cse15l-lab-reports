# Lab Report 4: Performing Tasks

## Log into ieng6 
`ssh cs15lsp23fj@ieng6.ucsd.edu`
`<Enter>`
Since we generated SSH Keys for ieng6 I don't have to retype the password for ieng6. after typing in the ssh and the account name + <enter> will log me back into the course account.
  
## Clone fork of the repository from Github account
`ls`
`git clone git@github.com:ReginaJhz/lab7.git`
`ls`
`<Enter>` 
before cloneing the repository make sure the folder does not contain any directories with the same name as the repository we are cloning. 
Then use `git clone` + `git@github.com:ReginaJhz/lab7.git`, which is the ssh link for the repository + `<enter>` to clone the repository. 
Then use ls to check the repository is successfully cloned.
