## Log into ieng6 


![Image](ieng6.png)

`ssh cs15lsp23fj@ieng6.ucsd.edu`
`<Enter>`
Since we generated SSH Keys for ieng6 I don't have to retype the password for ieng6. after typing in the ssh and the account name + <enter> will log me back into the course account.
 
  
## Clone fork of the repository from Github account
  
![Image](gitclone.png)
  
`ls`
  
  
`git clone git@github.com:ReginaJhz/lab7.git`

  
`ls`

  
`<Enter>` 

  
before cloneing the repository make sure the folder does not contain any directories with the same name as the repository we are cloning. 

  
Then use `git clone` + `git@github.com:ReginaJhz/lab7.git`, which is the ssh link for the repository + `<enter>` to clone the repository. 

  
Then use ls to check the repository is successfully cloned. 


## Run the tests, demonstrating that they fail
  
  
  ![Image]()

  
  `cd lab7` `ls` `javac ListExamplesTests.java` `Enter`
 
  First cd into the directory we are working on, then use `ls` to double check the files in lab7 folder. 
  
  
  Then use `javac ListExamplesTests.java` to compile the ListExamplesTests.java, which turns out to fail.
